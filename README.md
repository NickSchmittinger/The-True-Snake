# The True Snake

**The True Snake** is a reimagination of the classic game *Snake*, bringing new dimensions and exciting features to the timeless gameplay. In this version, I’ve taken the core concept and introduced modern mechanics, offering a fresh and customizable experience for both new players and fans of the original.

## Features

- **Omni-Directional Movement**: Unlike the original Snake, where movement is restricted to four directions, *The True Snake* allows you to move in any direction, giving you more control and adding a layer of strategy to the game.
  
- **Power-Ups**: Collect power-ups throughout the game to enhance your Snake's abilities. Whether it’s speed boosts, temporary invincibility, or other exciting effects, power-ups add depth to your gameplay.

- **Obstacles**: Navigate through increasingly challenging environments with obstacles that appear randomly. Avoiding these adds an extra challenge and keeps each game session fresh.

- **Points Tracker**: The game keeps track of your score based not just on length, but also the time you've survived. Compete to stay alive the longest and earn points for both your survival skills and your length.


## Future Plans

Here are some features we’re working on for upcoming updates:

- **New Snake Skins**: Unlock different skins to make your Snake stand out.
- **More Power-Ups**: Introducing new power-ups with unique effects to keep the game dynamic.
- **Leaderboards**: Compete globally and see how your skills stack up against other players.
- **Additional Obstacles and Challenges**: More complex environments for even greater difficulty.
- **Customizable Visuals and Audio**: Personalize your experience by choosing from a variety of visual and audio themes.
